###Example commit message:

	git commit -m "Details of changes"
	
### Pull latest branch before pushing your branch to the master
	
	git pull origin dev
	
	git push origin myFeature

###Some good practice for commit message:

-- Describe why a change is being made.

-- Ensure sufficient information to decide whether to review.

-- Multiple commit line if needed, the first commit line is the most important.

-- Describe any limitations of the current code.
